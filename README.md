# Car Market Dashboard

## Description
The Car Market Dashboard is a simple web app made for market owners to easily see and manage their car inventory. It's built using React.js with React Routing and uses Local Storage to save data. The app doesn't need a backend because it gets all the data from a local JSON file.

Features
Dashboard Page:
Car Count and Values by Brands and Models: A table that shows how many cars you have and their total value, grouped by brand and model.
Pie Chart: A chart that shows how many cars you have from each brand.
Stacked Bar Chart: A chart that shows the number of cars for each model within a brand.
Highlighted Cars Page:
Select and Remove Highlighted Cars: Pick cars to highlight on the page. The selected cars will stay highlighted even when you reload the page, thanks to Local Storage.
