# Car Market Dashboard

## Description
The **Car Market Dashboard** is a simple web app made for market owners to easily see and manage their car inventory. It's built using **React.js** with **React Routing** and uses **Local Storage** to save data. The app doesn't need a backend because it gets all the data from a local JSON file.

## Features

### Dashboard Page:
- **Car Count and Values by Brands and Models**: A table that shows how many cars you have and their total value, grouped by brand and model.
- **Pie Chart**: A chart that shows how many cars you have from each brand.
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: A chart that shows the number of cars for each model within a brand.

### Highlighted Cars Page:
- **Select and Remove Highlighted Cars**: Pick cars to highlight on the page. The selected cars will stay highlighted even when you reload the page, thanks to Local Storage.
